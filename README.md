## Scaffold and Electron

To run this Electron app you will need to install Electron. You will also need elm, npm, and node.

Convenience commands to do this:

```bash
npm install
```

To compile and run the app:

```bash
npm run elm
npm run start
```

To watch for changes to `*.elm` files, auto-compile when they change, and hot-reloading of the app:

```bash
npm run watch
```
